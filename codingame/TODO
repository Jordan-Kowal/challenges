# TODO

**Turn processing:**
- ~~`last_turn_light` and `last_turn_scans`~~
- ~~Store radar last_turn~~
- ~~Check manually if creature move a lot, if not, set an average x range~~

**Position estimate:**
- ~~Do not reset the position of those creatures~~
- ~~Keep grid of fish~~
- If scanned by foe (last turn), narrow the grid (based on light)
- Using radar and previous radar, narrow down the grid
- Maybe extend the grid for scanned fish

**Action:**
- Guess what the foe will do next round
- Figure out when to back and when to continue
- Update scoring mechanism for fish
- Update scoring for action pick
- Action: Back to base
- Action: Back to base with specific trajectory
- Allow scanning if something is very close
- Attr `is going home` to reset once no more scan
- Factor in "could be picked up on the way up" if not to far x-wise
- don't go toward fish if within 800 (or 2000 with light) but go to next instead
- get 2 best fish and move towards 2nd within 800m of 1st

- if foe returning? can I return before him? should I try to beat him?
