# TODO

**If foe has scanned ID last round, we can estimate the creature position**
- Estimate distance if light was used (battery has been used)
- Check manually if creature move a lot, if not, set an average x range
- Do not reset the position of those creatures
- `last_turn_light` and `last_turn_scans`
- Keep grid of fish
- update grid based on movement estimate
- if radar changes, narrow grid


**Action:**
- Guess what the foe will do next round
- Figure out when to back and when to continue
- Update scoring mechanism for fish
- Update scoring for action pick
- Action: Back to base
- Action: Back to base with specific trajectory
- Allow scanning if something is very close
- Attr `is going home` to reset once no more scan
- Factor in "could be picked up on the way up" if not to far x-wise
- don't go toward fish if within 800 (or 2000 with light) but go to next instead
- get 2 best fish and move towards 2nd within 800m of 1st

- if foe returning? can I return before him? should I try to beat him?
