# TODO

**Turn processing:**
- ~~`last_turn_light` and `last_turn_scans`~~
- ~~Store radar last_turn~~
- ~~Check manually if creature move a lot, if not, set an average x range~~

**Position estimate:**
- ~~Do not reset the position of those creatures~~
- ~~Keep grid of fish~~
- ~~Extend the grid each turn but within limits~~
- ~~If scanned by foe (last turn), narrow the grid (based on light)~~
- ~~Using radar to narrow down the grid~~
- ~~Narrow down the grid if radar has changed~~
- Creature within 1400u of moving ship will move in opposite direction.
- Compute vx/vy if fleeing (ie within motor)
- ~~Track if fish is out of X bounds~~
- ~~Update value of `Type/Color` computations if cannot be in the grid anymore~~

**Score computation**
- ~~Compute if scoring now would make us win?~~
  - ~~Compute maximum score possible~~
  - ~~If I bring THIS back and he has everything, would I win?~~
- ~~Take into account missing fishes~~

**Action:**
- ~~Update scoring mechanism for fish~~
- ~~Update weights for scoring mechanism~~
- ~~Add logic for action choice~~
- ~~Have 0 value for monster~~
- Enemy:
  - Guess what the foe will do next round
  - Guess if he is going back to base. Can I return before him? should I try to beat him?
- Move:
  - ~~When multiple drone, go diagonally to 3000 and 7000 at start~~
  - Get best 2-3 creatures and compute best trajectory
  - Make sure drones do not go to same target
  - Go to 2500 8000 and scan on the way
  - ~~Do not chase a missing fish~~
  - ~~Monster: Avoid monster~~
  - ~~Do not move out of bounds~~
  - Scan and push the fish if enemy does not have it
  - ~~If done, go push fish~~
- Save:
  - ~~Go straight up~~
  - ~~Maybe scan if something really close (ie add light)~~
