# TODO

**If foe has scanned ID last round, we can estimate the creature position**
- Estimate distance if light was used (battery has been used)
- Check manually if creature move a lot, if not, set an average x range
- Do not reset the position of those creatures
- `last_turn_light` and `last_turn_scans`


**Action:**
- Guess what the foe will do next round
- Figure out when to back and when to continue
- Update scoring mechanism for fish
- Update scoring for action pick
- Action: Back to base
- Action: Back to base with specific trajectory
- Allow scanning if something is very close
- Attr `is going home` to reset once no more scan
- Factor in "could be picked up on the way up" if not to far x-wise
